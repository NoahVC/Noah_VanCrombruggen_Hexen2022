 Assignment 1: Bomb worked as intended, also does not kill the player.
 
 Assignment 2: Could not hide cards within menu state, I believe this was because of the way my HandView was set up, which used the gameloop instances. Should I have more time (or knowledge) I would rewrite/refactor HandView and the deck creation logic within GameLoop to be within PlayGameState, which I believe would solve the issue.
